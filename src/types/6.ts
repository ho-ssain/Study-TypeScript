// In TypeScript, a tuple is a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements, each with a specific data type. Unlike arrays, where elements can have the same or different data types, a tuple enforces a specific data type and order for each element. Tuples provide type safety for situations where you need to work with data with a known structure.

// Tuples are particularly useful in scenarios where you have a well-defined structure, such as representing a point in 2D space with x and y coordinates or representing a pair of related values. They provide strong typing and help catch type-related errors at compile time.

let person: [string, number] = ["Hossain", 27];
